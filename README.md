# image-restoration-on-the-MNIST-dataset-using-an-autoencoder

To perform image restoration on the MNIST dataset using an autoencoder, you can follow these steps:

1. **Load and preprocess the dataset**: Start by loading the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. Preprocess the data by normalizing the pixel values to be between 0 and 1. Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set.

2. **Build the autoencoder model**: An autoencoder is a type of neural network that is trained to reconstruct its input data. It consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, while the decoder reconstructs the original input from this representation. Design the architecture of the autoencoder model, specifying the number of layers, the size of the latent space, and the activation functions for each layer.

3. **Compile and train the autoencoder**: Configure the model for training by specifying the optimizer and the loss function. The loss function should measure the difference between the input and the output of the autoencoder, encouraging the model to learn to reconstruct the images accurately. Fit the model to the training data, providing the original images as both the input and the target output.

4. **Evaluate the performance of the autoencoder**: Once training is complete, evaluate the performance of the autoencoder on the testing set. Calculate a suitable evaluation metric, such as mean squared error or peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), to assess how well the autoencoder can reconstruct the images.

5. **Perform image restoration**: To restore a damaged or incomplete image, provide the damaged image as input to the trained autoencoder. The autoencoder will reconstruct the missing or damaged parts of the image based on the learned patterns from the training data.

By following these steps, you can utilize an autoencoder to restore images from the MNIST dataset. The specific implementation may vary depending on the framework or programming language you are using, but the general process remains the same.
